Online anything-rating system - an **ASP.NET MVC** project

## The Idea
A platform for opinions

*	Register a page in any category - from business to favorite food or hobby
*	Choose *Like* or *Dislike* depending on your preferences
*	Let other people add their likes or dislikes and follow its ranking
*	Vote for other people's pages

Additionally, you can:

*	Add comments to pages
*	Browse random pages to like or dislike
*	Search pages by their name or category
*	View trending *Likes* and *Dislikes*
*	Follow the pages you've added, liked or disliked in your personal 'My Likes' section
*	Edit or delete your pages
